Library management system is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of a library. 
This system helps the system to keep the book records. 
The system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. 
It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book.

The main feature of this system is that all the books available in the library can be displayed in a list so that students need not roam 
through the entire library to find a book. Additionally, the application effectively maintains the details of users/students to whom books have been issued; 
it also records the issued date and return date.
